				<h1>GAMING GENUIS</h1>
				<p>
Words of wisdom:
“My definition of an adventure game is really an interactive story set with puzzles and obstacles to solve and worlds to explore. I believe that the ‘true’ adventure game genre will never die any more than any type of storytelling would ever die.” — Roberta Williams said on the future of adventure games in an interview with Adventure Classic Gaming. </p>

				<h1>USER INTERFACE GURU</h1>
				<p>
Words of wisdom:
“It is possible to teach most people to use one of these computers in about 20 minutes. A lot of that is because you can explain what an icon means and a person can remember it easily.” — Susan Kare on why Macs are so user friendly in an interview from the Computer Chronicles in 1984</p>

				<h1>COMPUTING VIRTUOSO</h1>
				<p>
Words of wisdom:
“My work on programming languages has always forced me to think in terms of what’s the interface? Is this a nice, simple thing? How do you trade off the expressive power versus the ease of use and so on? And this is very useful in the systems domain, as well as in the programming language domain.” — Barbara Liskov said on shifting from programming to systems at a OOPSLA Keynote. </p>

Words of wisdom:
